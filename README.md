# Snake Game
This is a Java version of the classic game Snake. You control a snake with your arrow keys and try to eat as many apples as possible without crashing into anything.

Just download the code, unzip it, and open it in any Java IDE. 

Then, right click on the ```culminating``` file and click **Run** to run the game!
